Hi Patrick,

 

Please note that on 22May20, new version of our ICSF released with few alteration and hence, could you please replace the attached new ICSF template into our DDAS application as soon as possible so our team could work without hassle.

 

Note, the fourth weblink (Adequate Assurance List) stopped working a while ago and hence, the website database extract was retained in the DDAS application to perform the search so far. However, we have now remove this weblink from our new ICSF and hence, we are no longer required to have the application perform the search on this web link too. So please do the required.

 

Hope this is clear and if not or if assistance required from us, please let us know.

 

Thanks & Kind Regards,

Dinesh R
