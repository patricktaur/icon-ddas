INVESTIGATIONAL HUMAN DRUGS

CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR INSPECTION LIST

The list contains the names, addresses and pertinent information gathered from inspections of clinical investigators who have performed studies with investigational human drugs.  The inspections were conducted as part of the Food and Drug's (FDA) Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which is in part designed to validate clinical studies on which drug approval may be based, and to assure that the rights and welfare of human subjects of those studies have been protected.

The list contains information relating to investigators inspected since July of 1977 and whose inspection files have been closed with a final classification.

If you have any questions concerning the list content, please contact Carolanne Currier, Division of Scientific Investigations, Good Clinical Practice Branch II, at (301) 827-7397 or e-mail: currier@cder.fda.gov.

The file is ASCII text tilde (~) delimited zipped into a self-extracting file, CLIIL.EXE (250KB will unzip to 1.1  MB).  The first record contains the field names.

The following describes Clinical Investigator Inspection List file content.

INVN:	 A 6 digit computer number unique to the clinical investigator.

LAST NAME:  The last name of the clinical investigator.

FIRST NAME:  The first name of the clinical investigator 

LOCATION: The location of the business of the investigator.  NG denotes Not Given.

ADDRESS:  The address of the site named above.  If a clinical investigator does not have a study or business site given, it will be the home address. NG denotes Not Given.

CITY:  The city location of the address.

STATE:  The 2 letter state code. 

ZIP CODE:  The zip code for the address.

COUNTRY:  The 2 letter country code.

INSPECTION DATE:  The initial start date of the Inspection.

CLASSIFICATION TYPE: 
DA  = Study-oriented.  An inspection in which the focus is on verification of study data.
FC = Investigator-orientated.  An inspection in which the focus is on the conduct of the study by the Clinical Investigator.

CLASSIFICATION CODE:
Inspections of clinical investigators are classified to reflect the compliance status of the inspectee at the time of the inspection, and the classification describes the recommended actions that should be taken, either by the inspectee or by FDA, as a result of the inspection.  There are three basic classifications:


NAI - No Action Indicated.  No objectionable conditions or practices were found during the inspection.

VAI - Voluntary Action Indicated.  Objectionable conditions were found but the problems do not justify further regulatory action.  Any corrective action is left to the investigator to take voluntarily.

OAI - Official Action Indicated.  Objectionable conditions were found and regulatory and/or administrative sanctions by FDA are indicated.

MTF - Case closed with a Memo To File.

The classification system has been modified several times over the years with additional letters and numbers to indicate certain specific subsets or levels of the three basic categories.  FOR ANY OF THE CLASSIFICATIONS, IT IS SUFFICIENT TO LOOK ONLY AT THE FIRST THREE LETTERS TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF THE RESULTS OF THE INSPECTION.  If you wish to know the details of the other letters or numbers  contact Carolanne Currier at (301-827-7397; currier@cder.fda.gov)

There are two additional administrative classifications:  CANC and WASH.  CANC indicates the inspection assignment was canceled before the inspection was started.  WASH (washout) indicates an inspection was initiated but no meaningful information could be obtained.
