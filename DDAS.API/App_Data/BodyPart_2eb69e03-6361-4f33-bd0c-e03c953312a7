npm update --save 
will update all packages inside package.json to their latest version according to their defined version range.

If you only want to update a specific package, for example angular2, then you can use 
npm update angular2 --save.

Note: A cool way to stay up to date with your packages' latest version is to use 
npm outdated 
which shows you all outdated packages together with their latest version - source
