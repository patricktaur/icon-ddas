 1. Able to test all sites using PhantomJS webdriver. Following was the issue while testing the page
 'Exclusions Database Search - http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov'

 Error: 
 'InvalidOperationException' - along with this error, the driver url, title and page source 
 were also empty! which shouldn't be.

 Solution: 
 Setting up SslProtocol property of the PhantomJSDriverService to "any" solved the problem.
 
 PhantomJSDriverService service = PhantomJSDriverService.CreateDefaultService();
 service.SslProtocol = "any";
 _Driver =  new PhantomJSDriver(service);

1. Going through MongoDB documentation to understand CRUD operations. 
2. Trying to add data into MongoDB.
3. Need to have the API connected to mongoDB to save downloaded records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 26 Sep 2016
1. Interfaces and classes of UnitOfWork and Repository for FDADebarpage are created by patrick.
2. Understanding the flow, how the MongoDB is connected with the models and pages.
3. Able to save data into mongoDB with using UnitOfWork and Repositories for ERRProposalToDebar page.

Entry on 27 Sep 2016
1. Able to save/add data for FDADebarPage and PHSAdministrativeActionListingPage into mongoDB.
2. Removed the Search method from the BaseSearchPage of return type ResultAtSite which is no longer valid
   as searching the names will be a seperate component. Currently the selenium component will only
   extract the data from the sites and save into mongoDB.
3. Required Changes made in the SearchEngine, ISearchEngine and ISearchPage to exclued the search
   method.
4. Added a new project, DDAS.Services, which will be containing the logic to search matching records
   from all sites and return the matching percentage along with the records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 28 Sep 2016
1. In the DDAS.Services, as discussed with patrick, added GetSearchSummary method to retrieve records from
   mongoDB and calculate the percentage/count of match for NameToSearch.
2. Unable to pull data from mongoDB, Error: Cannot create instance of an interface. 
   Need to understand the GetAll() function of mongoDB to pull the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The Norm driver was used to perform CRUD operations with MongoDB. The Add function in the repository was
   working but the GetAll function wasn't working. It was found that Norm driver was causing the problem.
2. Replaced the Norm driver with MongoDB driver and related queries or functions to add and read data from
   Mongo database. Able to add collections and read the same.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 30 Sep 2016
1. Able to read records from MongoDB and calculate the MatchSummary for the given Name to search.
2. For every collection added to the database for the same page/site, RecId is added as 0 and is not being
   incremented. Need to fix this.

Entry on 3 Oct 2016
1. One API call will be made to return the MatchStatus of all sites.
2. Currently, the API is returning match status for FDADebarPage.
3. Function to return the records matched has been updated and tested in a console application.
4. Need to genaralize functions in Search class and SiteScan class rather than having multiple functions
   for each page/site.
5. Identity to be integrated from Lakshmikanth into this project tomorrow.
