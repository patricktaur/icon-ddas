 1. Able to test all sites using PhantomJS webdriver. Following was the issue while testing the page
 'Exclusions Database Search - http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov'

 Error: 
 'InvalidOperationException' - along with this error, the driver url, title and page source 
 were also empty! which shouldn't be.

 Solution: 
 Setting up SslProtocol property of the PhantomJSDriverService to "any" solved the problem.
 
 PhantomJSDriverService service = PhantomJSDriverService.CreateDefaultService();
 service.SslProtocol = "any";
 _Driver =  new PhantomJSDriver(service);

1. Going through MongoDB documentation to understand CRUD operations. 
2. Trying to add data into MongoDB.
3. Need to have the API connected to mongoDB to save downloaded records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry on 27 Sep 2016
1. Able to save/add data for FDADebarPage and PHSAdministrativeActionListingPage into mongoDB.
2. Removed the Search method from the BaseSearchPage of return type ResultAtSite which is no longer valid
   as searching the names will be a seperate component. Currently the selenium component will only
   extract the data from the sites and save into mongoDB.
3. Required Changes made in the SearchEngine, ISearchEngine and ISearchPage to exclued the search
   method.
4. Added a new project, DDAS.Services, which will be containing the logic to search matching records
   from all sites and return the matching percentage along with the records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 28 Sep 2016
1. In the DDAS.Services, as discussed with patrick, added GetSearchSummary method to retrieve records from
   mongoDB and calculate the percentage/count of match for NameToSearch.
2. Unable to pull data from mongoDB, Error: Cannot create instance of an interface. 
   Need to understand the GetAll() function of mongoDB to pull the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 29 Sep 2016
1. The Norm driver was used to perform CRUD operations with MongoDB. The Add function in the repository was
   working but the GetAll function wasn't working. It was found that Norm driver was causing the problem.
2. Replaced the Norm driver with MongoDB driver and related queries or functions to add and read data from
   Mongo database. Able to add collections and read the same.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 30 Sep 2016
1. Able to read records from MongoDB and calculate the MatchSummary for the given Name to search.
2. For every collection added to the database for the same page/site, RecId is added as 0 and is not being
   incremented. Need to fix this.

2. Able to provide search summary MatchStatus as output using postman.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 3 Oct 2016
1. One API call will be made to return the MatchStatus of all sites.
2. Currently, the API is returning match status for FDADebarPage.
3. Function to return the records matched has been updated and tested in a console application.
4. Need to genaralize functions in Search class and SiteScan class rather than having multiple functions
   for each page/site.
5. Identity to be integrated from Lakshmikanth into this project tomorrow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 4 Oct 2016
1. API is now returning the fields or properties of FDADebarPage which match the NameToSearch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 5 Oct 2016
1. ClinicalInvestigatorInspectionPage has been included into the serives, to return match status and the
   fields/properties that match the NameToSearch.
2. Observation: This site (CII) is providing only 200 records max. when follwed the method
   Advanced Search --> Select First Name drop down value "not equal to" --> enter the first name "zzzzz".
   Site gives 200 records when searched for the name "James" without using advanced search.
   Need to cross check this with clients.
3. Need to explore SAM site to find a way to download all records. 'Document Access' tab has some
   files which need to be investigated/looked into.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 6 Oct 2016
1. ClinicalInvestigatorInspectionPage: There's a downloadable zip file at

3. These extracts have about 1.4L records. Need to check with clients whether this information can be used
   instead of online search.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 14 Oct 2016

1. As per the discussion with clients - CIIL, FDAWarningLetters, Disqualified proceedings, database 
   exclusion list and SAM site will be live search sites. Others will be scanned every 24 hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 18 Oct 2016
1. FDAWarningLetters and DisqualificationProceedings have 500 and 225 records respectively. But when
   when searched for a specific name, they show same number of records which should not be the case.
   hence live search to be carried out for these two.
2. CIIL has downloadable database but the date when database is updated is older(available on the download page)
   to that of database updated date available on the CIIL page. Currently using downloadable file and storing
   data into mongo.

Entry on 26 Oct 2016
1. Re-designing the database structure so that the pattern is same for live and non-live sites.
2. For the non-live sites, the data will be scanned/downloaded and saved into mongoDB. When searched for a 
   name, the records matching the NameToSearch will be saved into another collection and fetched.
3. For the live sites, data will directly be downloaded for matching records and saved into database.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 27 Oct 2016
1. Discussion on Re-structuring the database design. Method 2 is to save matched records from the live sites
   in the same structure to that of non live sites. 
2. Going with the Method 1, to save matched records of non live sites into different collection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry on 28 Oct 2016 
1. Creating repository, interfaces and classes for FDADebarPage to return the matching records.
2. Database is structured such that, Compliance form details will be provided from the front end.
   For each name, a compliance form is to be generated.
3. Need to use OpenXml to create word document (compliance form) on the server for each Search name.
